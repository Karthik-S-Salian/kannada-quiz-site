# React Environment Setup with Vite.js

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js: You must have Node.js installed on your system. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

## Getting Started

To set up your React environment with Vite.js, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone or Fork the Repository

You can either clone this repository to your local machine or fork it and then clone your fork. Use one of the following commands:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Karthik-S-Salian/kannada-quiz-site.git
```

or

1. Fork this repository by clicking the "Fork" button at the top right of this page.
2. Clone your forked repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Karthik-S-Salian/kannada-quiz-site.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory

Change your working directory to the project folder:

```bash
cd react-vite-template
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Use npm or yarn to install the project dependencies:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install

# Using yarn
yarn install
```

### 4. Start the Development Server

You can now start the development server:

```bash
# Using npm
npm run dev

# Using yarn
yarn dev
```

The development server should now be running. By default, it will be available at `http://localhost:3000`. You can open this URL in your web browser to see your React application.

### 5. Start Building Your React App

Now that your development environment is set up, you can start building your React application. You'll find the source code for your React app in the `src` directory.

### 6. Customize Configuration (Optional)

You can customize the Vite configuration by editing the `vite.config.js` file in the root directory. This allows you to adjust various settings such as development server options, build options, and more.

### 7. Build for Production (Optional)

When you are ready to deploy your React application, you can create a production build using the following command:

```bash
# Using npm
npm run build

# Using yarn
yarn build
```

This will generate optimized production-ready files in the `dist` directory.
